# marstoday.ru-rebuild

The application is available <a href='https://marstoday.ru/'>here</a>

This was my first project, so it was written without separating the code, and also without taking into account new trends and opportunities. 

I am planning:

1. To rewrite the project using React (like I did with the game - https://github.com/martetz/our-reality-game)

2. To split into several independent modules - such as "calendar" and "gallery-slider"

You can view the old code in the folder 'old-marstoday', but you better not :) Okay, you can, but let me not feel the Spanish shame of my past:)
